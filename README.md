# myfirstbioblendscript

Welcome to Will's very first bioblend script!

There isn't much here at the moment, as the script doesn't do much yet.

Just know that you will need an API key of an admin user to run the script, like so:

```
python myfirstbioblendscript.py --apikey [apikey]
```

From there, the script will do little more than create API keys for the users that don't have one already. More things are planned, though.

See you soon! 再见！
